# HangmanConsole
Hangman game in Java Console for 1 or 2 players.
If the 1 player option is chosen, a random word will be picked from the attached .txt file in the /src folder and we can guess the word ourselves. If 2 player option is chosen,
player 1 can enter a word and there will be many new lines printed, because we cannot hide that word otherwise in the Java Console. Let us hope, player 2 will not scroll
up to check the given word :)
Either way we got 6 chances if we could not pick the correct letters, after that if we reached the 6th wrong letter, the game is over.
